/**
 * Using Filesâ€”Numeric Processing
 * 
 * If you have downloaded the source code, you will find a file named Random.txt in the Chapter 5 folder
 * (it is also present in Canvas). This file contains a long list of random numbers. Copy the file to your
 * hard drive and then write a program that opens the file, reads all the numbers from the file, and
 * calculates the following:
 * 
 *   The number of numbers in the file
 * 
 *   The sum of all the numbers in the file (a running total)
 * 
 *   The average of all the numbers in the file
 * 
 * The program should display the number of numbers found in the file, the sum of the numbers, and the
 * average of the numbers
